The Fig1d.mat file needs to be opened in Matlab using the "load" command.\
data{1,1} is the resistance ($k\Omega$)\
data{1,2} is the x-axis voltage (V)\
data{1,3} is the y-axis voltage (V)\
data{1,4} is the x-axis carrier density ($10^{11} cm^{-2}$)\
data{1,5} is the original y-axis carrier density ($10^{11} cm^{-2}$)\
data{1,6} is the normalized y-axis carrier density ($10^{11} cm^{-2}$), considering the gate-dependent fringing field effect that was mentioned in Supplementary Note 1
