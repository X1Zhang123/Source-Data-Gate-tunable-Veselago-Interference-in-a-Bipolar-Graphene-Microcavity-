The Supplementary_Fig14.mat file needs to be opened in Matlab using the "load" command.\
data{1,1} is the resistance ($k\Omega$)\
data{1,2} is the gate 1 voltage (V)\
data{1,3} is the gate 2 voltage (V)\
data{1,4} is the gate 1 region carrier density ($cm^{-2}$), which is converted by the estimated capacitance of hBN and the position of Dirac peak (charge neutrality point)\
data{1,5} is the gate 2 region carrier density ($cm^{-2}$), which is converted by the estimated capacitance of hBN and the position of Dirac peak (charge neutrality point)
