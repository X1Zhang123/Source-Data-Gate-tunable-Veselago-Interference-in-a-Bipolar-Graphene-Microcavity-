The Supplementary_Fig4.mat file needs to be opened in Matlab using the "load" command.\
data{1,1} is the resistance ($k\Omega$)\
data{1,2} is the gate voltage (V)\
data{1,3} is the carrier density ($ cm^{-2}$), which is converted by the estimated capacitance of hBN and the position of Dirac peak (charge neutrality point)\
data{1,4} is the magnetic field (T)
